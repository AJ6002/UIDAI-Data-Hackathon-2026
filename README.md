# UIDAI-Data-Hackathon-2026
This project moves beyond descriptive statistics to build a Diagnostic Pipeline for the UIDAI ecosystem. By integrating Enrolment, Demographic, and Biometric datasets, we identify districts where "Update Intensity" (the ratio of maintenance activity to new creation) suggests systemic data quality issues or operational bottlenecks.
